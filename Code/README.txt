This folder contains the code that I've written

* DataScripts.py is a set of scripts written to collect
  and cultivate a dataset. I would ignore it, it doesn't
  mean much.

* AWS.py handled connections to Amazon Web Services. This
  is now outdated since the switch to Tensorflow.
  
* Firms.py handles the updating and pulling of data from 
  .txts containing data from the firms that I track.
  
* Main.py is a miscellanious file, ultimately containing
  the day() function, which adds a new day to the subreddit.
  
* NTSBbot.py handles posting things to Reddit.

* NeuralNetwork.py contains the model training code. This is
  outdated, as I'm working on the file regularly.
  
* config.py is a partially redacted file, containing
  some general configuration data. The real version contains
  things like passwords.
  
* pData.py handles collecting and processing data on a
  semi-frequent basis.
